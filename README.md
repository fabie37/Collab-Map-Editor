## Installation

You'll need a mongodb account set up with a cluster to use it and a file called ".env" in the "backend" folder (this file is in gitignore so wont be pushed).

 

The ".env" file has to contain the following:
 
SESSION_SECRET=secret
MONGO_DB_CONNECTION=<the link you get from your mongodb cluster under connect menu>

 

Make sure Node.js is installed https://nodejs.org/en/download/

 

run both frontend and backend separately with command: npm run dev

 

Dependencies werent pushed so you'll need to install them. If this is too cumbersome, let me know and I'll push dependencies too (about 200mb)

 

To download frontend dependencies, navigate to frontend folder in terminal and execute (one by one):
npm install axios
npm install bootstrap
npm install moment
npm install react
npm install reactstrap
npm install react-dom
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-scripts
npm install socket.io-client
npm install web-vitals
npm install ol

 

To download backend dependencies, navigate to backend folder in terminal and execute (one by one):
npm install bcrypt
npm install cors
npm install dotenv
npm install express
npm install jsonwebtoken
npm install mongoose
npm install nodemon
npm install multer
npm install socket.io
